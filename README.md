# Prefix Notation Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using **prefix notation** (also known as Polish notation), where operators precede their operands.

## ðŸ“˜ What is Prefix Notation?

In prefix notation, the operator comes **before** the operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to indicate order of operations.

### Examples:
- Traditional: `3 + 4` â†’ Prefix: `+ 3 4`
- Traditional: `(5 - 2) * 4` â†’ Prefix: `* - 5 2 4`

## ðŸ”¢ Supported Operations

The calculator currently supports the following basic arithmetic operations:

| Operation | Symbol |
|----------|--------|
| Addition | `+`    |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Division | `/`   |
